## Data Science Tools
* PostgreSQL 11 for designing tables, importing data, and querying the database
* QuickDBD for creating Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## Features
The project successfully models, imports, and analyzes employee data from the given CSV files. Various insights, such as employee numbers, names, salaries, hire dates, managers, and department details, can be extracted by constructing SQL queries to the database.

## Limitations and Further Development
* Creating visualizations to better communicate the results to stakeholders
* Implementing advanced analytics, such as forecasting or clustering, to gain deeper insights
